1. SCOPE. This framework Agreement governs Wind River's provision to 
Customer of the Products and Services as detailed in the Quote or 
Exhibit. Terms in initial capitalized letters, not defined elsewhere in 
this Agreement, have the meanings set forth in Section 12 (Definitions).

2. LICENSE. Each program, component or application included in the 
Software may be governed by one or more Open Source License(s), as 
specified or referenced in the respective Source Code files.  Without 
limiting the foregoing, for the convenience of Customer, Wind River will 
make available, upon request, applicable licensing information in the 
Linux Foundation's SPDX(R) format. Tools provided to Customer shall be 
licensed under the terms of the attached Appendix A, which is hereby 
incorporated by reference into this Agreement.  

3. SERVICES.
3.1. Support. Customer's payment of the applicable fees entitles 
Customer to Support during the License Term. Support is provided in 
accordance with the terms of Wind River's then current Software Support 
and Maintenance Agreement, which terms are hereby incorporated by 
reference into this Agreement. A copy of the curr ent Software Support 
and Maintenance Agreement can be accessed through Wind River's website:

4. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Customer will not use or disclose any 
Confidential Information, except as expressly authorized by this 
Agreement, and will protect all such Confidential Information using the 
same degree of care that Customer uses with respect to its own 
proprietary information, but in no event less than reasonable care. If 
Confidential Information must be disclosed to a third party by reason of 
legal, accounting or regulatory requirements beyond the reasonable 
control of Customer, Customer will: (i) assert the confidential nature 
of the information in the action or proceeding; (ii) promptly notify 
Wind River of the order or request; and (iii) permit Wind River (at its 
own expense) to seek an appropriate protective order.

5. TERM AND TERMINATION.  
5.1. Term.  The term of this Agreement will commence upon the Effective 
Date and continue until expiration of the License Term unless earlier 
terminated as set forth herein. The renewal date for all Products and 
Services hereunder will be the last day of the applicable License Term, 
regardless of whether Customer chooses to license additional Products 
during such License Term. Customer must notify Wind River at least 
thirty (30) days prior to the end of the License Term of its request to 
renew its subscription. Unless the parties mutually agree to renew the 
subscription, and Customer pays the then-applicable fees, Customer's 
license to the Tools and entitlement to Support will terminate on the 
last day of the then-current License Term.

5.2. Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately 
upon notice for the material breach of the other party, which breach is 
curable and has remained uncured for a period of thirty (30) days from 
the date of notice. In addition, Wind River may immediately terminate 
this Agreement if Customer is delinquent on its payment obligations for 
thirty (30) days or more.

5.3. Consequences of Expiration or Termination. Upon expiration of the 
License Term or termination of this Agreement, Customer will: (a) not 
use the Tools for any purpose whatsoever; (b) no longer be entitled to 
receive or have access to Support or other Services; (c) immediately 
destroy or return to Wind River all material belonging to Wind River or 
its licensors, including, without limitation, all Confidential 
Information of Wind River then in Customer's possession; and (d) 
promptly certify to Wind River in writing that Customer has completed 
the actions described in the foregoing subsections. These remedies will 
be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies available to Wind 
River. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 will survive expiration 
or termination of this Agreement.

6. DELIVERY, PAYMENT AND TAXES.
6.1. Delivery and Payment Terms.
6.1.1. The Product will be deemed irrevocably accepted upon shipment. 
When Product is made available to Customer for electronic download 
through access to a website and/or server, shipment will be deemed to 
have occurred at the time of such availability.
6.1.2. Customer will pay Wind River the fees set forth in the applicable 
Exhibit or Quote.  Wind River will invoice Customer the applicable fees 
upon receipt of a correctly issued purchase order from Customer, which 
may coincide with shipment of the Software or Tools. Payment terms 
herein are subject to prior credit approval by Wind River. Customer will 
pay all invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice in 
U.S. dollars unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Exhibit or 
Quote. Interest on late payments will accrue at the rate of one and 
one-half percent (1.5%) per month or partial month, or, if lower, the 
highest rate permitted by law.  Customer is responsible for reasonable 
costs associated with collection of overdue amounts, including without 
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.  Failure to pay 
any invoice in the manner described in this Section 6 may, at Wind 
River's discretion, be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
6.1.3. If Products or Services are purchased through an authorized Wind 
River distributor, Customer will be invoiced directly by such 
distributor (and not Wind River), and Customer will pay the distributor 
the applicable fees in accordance with the payment terms agreed to 
between Customer and the distributor.

6.2. Purchase Orders. Unless Products or Services are purchased through 
an authorized Wind River distributor, Customer will submit to Wind River 
a purchase order in the amount specified in the corresponding Exhibit or 
Quote. Any additional or different terms and conditions on the purchase 
order will be of no force or effect. Wind River may reject any purchase 
order that Wind River determines to be outside the scope of this 
Agreement.

6.3. Taxes. All amounts due hereunder will be paid without deduction, 
set-off or counter claim, free and clear of any restrictions or 
conditions, and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, 
duties, fees, deductions, withholdings or other governmental charges.  
If any deduction is required to be made by law, Customer will pay the 
full amount owed to Wind River plus the amount to be deducted, so that 
Wind River will receive the same amount as it would have received had 
the deduction not been required.  If Customer is claiming sales or use 
tax exemption, a valid and fully executed Tax Exempt Certificate must be 
attached to this Agreement or the applicable Quote or Exhibit, or the 
applicable purchase order.  Customer will promptly pay or reimburse all 
taxes (exclusive of taxes on Wind River's net income), duties and 
assessments arising from amounts payable to Wind River under this 
Agreement, or furnish Wind River with evidence acceptable to the taxing 
authority to sustain exemption therefrom.

7. CUSTOMER COMPLIANCE.  Wind River or its designated representative 
will have the right to: (a) require that Customer send a written 
certification of compliance with the terms of this Agreement within 
fifteen (15) days of Wind River's request; and (b) conduct an inspection 
and audit ("Audit") upon reasonable notice of the relevant operational, 
accounting and sales books and records of Customer and any other 
information within Customer's possession or control that is reasonably 
necessary to determine whether Customer has complied with this 
Agreement, and obtain true and correct photocopies of the foregoing 
materials.  Such Audit will be conducted during regular business hours 
at Customer's offices and so as not to interfere unreasonably with 
Customer's normal business activities.  Customer will permit or provide 
for completion of any Audit within forty-five (45) days of notice.  If 
an Audit discloses any underpayment of fees, then Wind River will 
invoice Customer for, and Customer will promptly pay Wind River, the 
underpaid fee amount based on the higher of the price specified in this 
Agreement or Wind River's price list in effect at the time the audit is 
completed, together with late payment interest in accordance with 
Section 6.1 (Delivery and Payment Terms). If an Audit discloses 
underpayment of five percent (5%) or more, then Wind River will also 
invoice Customer for, and Customer will promptly pay, Wind River's 
reasonable costs of conducting the Audit.

8. LIMITED WARRANTY.

8.1. Limited Warranty. The Software is provided "AS IS". In no event 
does Wind River warrant that the Software is error free or that the 
Software will satisfy Customer's own specific requirements. Customer 
assumes full responsibility for: (a) the selection of the Product; (b) 
the proper installation and use of the Products; (c) verifying the 
results obtained from the use of the Products; and (d) taking 
appropriate measures to prevent loss of data.
    
8.2. Warranty Disclaimer.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 8.1 
ABOVE, WIND RIVER AND ITS LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, 
IMPLIED AND STATUTORY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE 
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS 
AND SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN 
INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY WIND RIVER, ITS DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, 
AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES WILL IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THE WARRANTIES 
PROVIDED BY WIND RIVER IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE APPLICABLE OPEN SOURCE 
LICENSES.  WIND RIVER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE QUALITY OR PERFORMANCE 
OF ANY PRODUCT AND SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT 
CUSTOMER WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR RESULTS FROM USE OR 
MODIFICATION OF THE PRODUCT, OR THAT THE PRODUCT WILL OPERATE FREE FROM 
ERROR.  WIND RIVER MAKES NO WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY MALFUNCTIONS OR 
OTHER ERRORS IN ITS PRODUCTS CAUSED BY VIRUS, INFECTION, WORM OR SIMILAR 
MALICIOUS CODE NOT DEVELOPED BY WIND RIVER.  WIND RIVER MAKES NO 
WARRANTY THAT ANY PRODUCTS OF WIND RIVER WILL PROTECT AGAINST ALL 
POSSIBLE SECURITY THREATS, INCLUDING INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT BY THIRD 
PARTIES.  WIND RIVER IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DOWNTIME OR SERVICE 
INTERRUPTION, FOR ANY LOST OR STOLEN DATA OR SYSTEMS, OR FOR ANY OTHER 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY SUCH ACTIONS OR INTRUSIONS.  
Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of implied 
warranties or how long an implied warranty may last, so the above 
limitations may not apply to Customer.  This warranty gives Customer 
specific legal rights and Customer may have other rights that vary from 
jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

9. CUSTOMER INDEMNITY. Customer will defend at its expense Wind River 
against any claims, suits, or proceedings brought against Wind River by 
third parties resulting from, in connection with, attributable to any 
Customer product or service incorporating or using the Software, or by 
Customer's direct or indirect end users, and will indemnify Wind River 
for any costs, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable legal 
fees) resulting from or in connection with such claim, suit, or 
proceeding. Customer's obligations under this Section are conditioned on 
Wind River: (a) providing Customer prompt notice of such claim, suit, or 
proceeding; (b) tendering to Customer the defense or settlement of any 
such claim, suit, or proceeding at Customer's expense; and (c) 
cooperating with Customer, at Customer's expense, in defending or 
settling such claim, suit, or proceeding.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. WIND RIVER AND ITS LICENSORS WILL NOT BE 
LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE 
OR GOODWILL, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS 
OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, OR LOSS OF 
DATA, OR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE 
FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT 
PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, EVEN IF WIND 
RIVER HAS BEEN ADVISED OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL WIND RIVER'S AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY 
FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE 
AMOUNTS PAID TO WIND RIVER BY CUSTOMER FOR THE AFFECTED PRODUCT OR 
SERVICES PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING 
THE CLAIM.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation 
of incidental or consequential damages so this limitation and exclusion 
may not apply to Customer.

THE LIMITED WARRANTY, LIMITED REMEDIES, WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED 
LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN 
WIND RIVER AND CUSTOMER. WIND RIVER WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE 
PRODUCTS OR SERVICES WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.

11. GENERAL.
11.1. Governing Law and Venue. This Agreement will be governed in all 
respects by the laws of the United States of America and the State of 
Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws principles. The United

participating in US export transactions by any federal agency of the US 
government. Some of Wind River's products are classified as "restricted" 
encryption products under Section 740.17(b)(2) of the EAR and may not be 
exported or re-exported to government end-users (as defined in Section 
772 of the EAR) outside the countries listed in Supplement No. 3 to Part 
740 of the EAR without authorization from the U.S. government.

thereto or derived therefrom are "commercial items" as defined in 48 
C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and 
"commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 
48 C.F.R. 12.212.  If the end User is a U.S. Government agency, 
department, or instrumentality, then the use, duplication, reproduction, 
release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software and any

C.F.R. 227.7202, as applicable.  Customer will provide the Software to 
the U.S. Government or to U.S. Government end Users only pursuant to an 
end user license agreement in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement. This U.S. Government end users clause is in lieu of, and

11.6. Use of Customer's Name. Subject to Customer's approval, Wind River 
may identify Customer as a customer of Wind River products or services.

11.7. Assignment. Customer will not assign, transfer or delegate any

all or any part of the business or assets of Customer, or undergo a 
change of Control, without first obtaining Wind River's prior written 
consent, which Wind River may withhold in Wind River's sole discretion.  
Any purported assignment, transfer, delegation or change of Control in 
violation of this Section 11.7 (Assignment) is null and void.  Wind 
River may assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement or any right, 
license or obligation hereunder in its sole discretion.

11.8. Counterparts. In the event th is Agreement is executed with 
signatures, this Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, 
each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will

transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable 
document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means 
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a 
document, will have the same effect as a signed original of this 
Agreement.

11.9. Waiver. The failure of either party to require performance by the 
other party of any provision hereof will not affect the full right to 
require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will the waiver by 
either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be 
a waiver of the provision itself.

11.10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement will not create any agency, 
employment relationship, partnership or other form of joint enterprise 
between the parties. This Agreement and its attachments and exhibits 
constitute the entire agreement between Customer and Wind River and 
supersedes all prior oral or written agreements between the parties with 
respect to the subject matter hereof.  The terms and conditions of any 
purchase order or other instrument issued by Customer in connection with 
this Agreement will be of no force or effect.  This Agreement may only

protective measures in the Tools are included solely as a matter of
